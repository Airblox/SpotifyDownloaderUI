# SpotifyDownloaderUI
This is a small project, done in one day. Powered by the builtin Python library `Tkinter`, this application allows users to download songs off Spotify with metadata with `spotDL` (see more [here](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader)).

### Installation
Press `Code`, then download the zip file. Run `main.py`. Please have Python installed.

### Features
* Simple and easy
* Highly-customisable (thanks to `spotDL`)
